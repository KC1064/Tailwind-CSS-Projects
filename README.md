# Tailwind-CSS-Projects
This repository showcases all the projects Iâ€™ve completed to master Tailwind CSS and build responsive websites using it.

## Project-01: A Landing Page
- This is a simple landing page that I build as my first step toward learning tailwind.
- It a single page website with minimilistic design.
- It is fully responsive and looks great on all devices.

## Project-02: EdTech Event
- This is a website made for an EdTech with all the sections like Header,footer,navbar etc.
- There are some minimal animation and easy to understand UI.

***NOTE: These projects are not some high level projects these projects are just projects I did to test  out my skills in tailwind.***
